## How it Works?

1. Login and Registration are done by Django Inbuilt Authentication System.
2. When you register your data is save in SQLite3 Data base.
3. When Login you are authenticated by Django Itself.
4. After authenticatiton and logged in you can see the memories you added to your DayBook.
5. Upper Right corner you can see Add New Diary button and Sign Out button.
6. You can Add new Diary by clicking New Diary button and you can use Markdown to add new Diary entry.
7. Date is automatically added.
8. When You submit your New Diary, your data stored in Database with your user id, which automatically made by django itself while you register.
